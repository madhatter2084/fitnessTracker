## Description

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a Workout Tracker using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema. We are also handling routes with Express.

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Installation

- Express
- Mongoose
- Morgan


## Usage

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

- Add exercises to previous workout plan
- Add new exercises to a new workout plan
- View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page
